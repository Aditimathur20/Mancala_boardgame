About The Game : Mancala

This Project is on “MANCALA GAME” Computer Graphics using OpenGL Functions. It is a User interactive program where in the User can play the game by making use of the input devices like Keyboard and Mouse. This project mainly consists of a board game. Mancala, is one of the oldest games played. Mancala is a generic name for a family of 2-player turn-based strategy board games played with small stones, beans,or seeds and rows of holes or pits in the earth, a board or other playing surface. The objective is usually to capture all or some set of the opponent's stones, beans, etc.Versions of the game have been played for at least hundreds of years around the world.

Overview

This is a two player game – Player 1 and Player 2.These two have to compete with each other to collect as many stones as possible in
order to win. The initial display screens consists of project details and the instructions for the game. The players start the game by
selecting maximum stone containing polygons and each get one chance for the same. Apart from it bonus chance is given to leading
players. The player who ends up with maximum stones is their allotted polygon shaped stores at the side wins the game.

     
User interface

A set of keys are used to change the following:
Use arrow keys to move and press enter for play.
Begin the game with left click and then right and then read the instructions, how to play the game.
After finishing the reading proceed to play by left click.

OBJECTIVE:

The objective of most two- and three-row mancala games is to capture more stones than the opponent; in four-row games, one usually seeks to leave the opponent with no legal move or sometimes to capture all counters in their front row.

At the beginning of a player's turn, they select a hole with seeds that will be sown around the board. This selection is often limited to holes on the current player's side of the board, as well as holes with a certain minimum number of seeds.

In a process known as sowing, all the seeds from a hole are dropped one-by-one into subsequent holes in a motion wrapping around the board. Sowing is an apt name for this activity, since not only are many games traditionally played with seeds, but placing seeds one at a time in different holes reflects the physical act of sowing. If the sowing action stops after dropping the last seed, the game is considered a single lap game.

Multiple laps or relay sowing is a frequent feature of mancala games, although not universal. When relay sowing, if the last seed during sowing lands in an occupied hole, all the contents of that hole, including the last sown seed, are immediately re-sown from the hole. The process usually will continue until sowing ends in an empty hole. Another common way to receive "multiple laps" is when the final seed sown lands in your designated hole.

Many games from the Indian subcontinent use pussa kanawa laps. These are like standard multilaps, but instead of continuing the movement with the contents of the last hole filled, a player continues with the next hole. A pussakanawa lap move will then end when a lap ends just prior to an empty hole. If a player ends his stone with a point move he gets a "free turn"
